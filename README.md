<h1>News Feeds</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>My first project completed using the JavaScript library, <b>React</b>. This is a single page application 
that allows users to select a news source (CNN, Fox, CyberNews, etc) and displays up to 10 top stories from
that source. The user can scroll through each story, which displays the headline and an image. If the user
wants to read the story, they can tap the image/headline to be redirected to the new source's website.<p>
<p>I used this app to stay up to date on everything that was happening with Covid through 2020.
Unfortunately near the end of the year, the API service that provided the news objects was discontinued and
my app stopped working. :(</p>
